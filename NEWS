# 0.3.24

# 0.3.23

* Support links and images in footnotes and endnotes.

# 0.3.22

* Add support for underlines in style map.

* Add support for strikethrough.

# 0.3.21

* Add basic support for text boxes. The contents of the text box are treated as
  a separate paragraph that appears after the paragraph containing the text box.

# 0.3.20

* Support styles defined without a name

# 0.3.19

* Add ignoreEmptyParagraphs option, which defaults to true.

# 0.3.18

* Make style names case-insensitive in style mappings. This should make style
  mappings easier to write, especially since Microsoft Word sometimes represents
  style names in the UI differently from in the style definition. For instance,
  the style displayed in Word as "Heading 1" has  a style name of "heading 1".
  This hopefully shouldn't cause an issue for anyone, but if you were relying
  on case-sensitivity, please do get in touch.

# 0.3.0

* Rename the existing concept of a "style name" to "style ID" to correspond to
  the terminology used internally in docx files. Any document transforms that
  get or set the `styleName` property should use the `styleId` property instead.

* Allow paragraphs and runs to be matched by style name. For instance, to match
  a paragraph with the style name `Heading 1`:
  
    p[style-name='Heading 1']
    
* Use an array of raw strings rather than an array of style mappings when
  passing options to convertToHtml.
